# TradingLab
Hyper Hybrid Crypto Trading Community

## Introduction
At the time of writing this document, the total market capitalisation of the crypto industry has reached two trillion
dollars.
In a really conservative scenario this amount will double within years, thanks to capital injection of
institutional investors as well as amatorial investors, both attracted by the idea of quick gains as well as the feeling of pioneering a whole new industry.

## Vision
Creation of a never ending user experience in which crypto passionates can learn and earn from each other.
Thanks to the power of blockchain technology it is possibile to create sophysticated yet simple financial transactions between users, and between users and TradingLab.

## Description of the market and the problem
TradingLab has identified two key stakeholders playing an important role into the crypto economy: experienced traders
and new entry traders. In this document we will define the former as *influencers*, while the latter as *subscribers*.

### Influencers
We define as influencers those traders which have been able to successfully create an online community around their
talent. Their main communication medium are tools such as Twitter, Reddit, Discord and Youtube.
Their approach is often to create curiosity and FOMO around their successes.
They often share charts and graphical representations on their ideas.
Despite so, it is rare to see an influencer sharing precisly the amount invested, or the total profit generated. 
Influencers are leaders able to take initiative.

### Subscribers
We define as subscribers those traders which have interest in crypto but still not fully part of the movement. Their
lack of experience and risk adversion are a limit of the potential of their success. They like to follow other traders,
gathering ideas of new tokens to invest on, as well as when it is time to enter. For a subscriber it is difficult
to choose an influencer to follow, the amount of information available online is often overwhealming, as well as, the
risk of being exposed to scammers. 
Subscribers do not want to lead.

## Market
There are many portfolio trackers available online. Automatically or manually, they allow anybody to keep track of the
behavior of cryto holdings. Many of them are too complex to use, generating confusion and uncertanties. Others, are more user friendly, but black boxed, so not easy to be shared across users. Finally there are fully automated ones, able to import data directly from trading platforms, but in this case there is always a limit in terms of security, as well as the ability to stay up do date with a contoniously evolving crypto industry.

## Description of the product and how itâ€™s going to solve the problem
This section describes the key features of TradingLab and what makes it unique and special.

### Portfolio
At the core TradingLab is a portfolio tracker.
Focusing on a clear and minimal design, it allows to seamlessy keep track of a
certain crypto investment.
The data insertion is fully manual, there is no plan to introduce automation in that area.

### Community
Each user as a public fully visibile profile.
In this way TradingLab wants to offer an "ininitive" scrolling experience, because it will be fun and easy to jump to a
new profile, exploring other traders, their favuoirite crypto and their opened positions.
Nevertheless, a user has total control of their privacy, choosing a different visibility setting between private,
followers and subscribers.

### Real time
There are two main components updated in real time: prices and trades.
Whenever a crypto price changes, data are sent to the plaform, refreshing all the stats of a particular user.
In the same way, whenever a user_a changes something about a trade, every other user which is currently observing the profile of user_a will see immidiatly the changes, this is due to a websockets based algorithm.

### On-chain data
TradingLab stores on-chain only data about trades and few other data points to allow a smooth user experience. 

### Decentralisation
As crypto platform, TradingLab aims to be a fully working dapp.
Users are able to enter the plaform using their Metamask wallets, this means TradingLab does not store any personal data.

### Blockchain
TradingLab has choosen Polkadot/Kusama's ecosytsem has blockchain platform.
As third generation blockchain, they offer a level of security, speed and fees fully aligned with the needs of TradingLab.
In particular, what Moonbeam foundation is building is optimal for TradingLab, due to the possibility to
write smart contract in solidity, as well as using the excellent tool chains developed for the Ethereum ecosystem.
Moreover, their fresh and innovative image is also aligned with the spirit of TradingLab.
The idea is to propose TradingLab to receive a grant from Moonriver or Polkaddot foundations. 

### Smart contracts
Smart contracts are used to regulate the interactions between influencers and subscribers.
Moreover TradingLab aims to introduce special ad-hoc services, such as enhancing the profile with custom art. Also in
this case, to purchase certain benefits, a smart contract interaction is necessary.

### Win-win apporach
TradingLab has created a software able to offer a win-win solution to both influencers and subscribers. The former are
finally able to monetise their talent, while the latter are finally able to learn from the best.
Influencers have a place where to share their trades and portfolio, and thanks to a subscription model, earning from it.
Subscribers have a place to manage their portfolio, 

## Tokens
The creation of a token dedicated to TradingLab, despite not being a truly proproty, allows the creation of really interesting scenarios.
As first, to ensure a truly decentralized apporach, a token could be used to gain bote power for a DAO.
The token could allow the creation of initiatives, campaigns, and lotteries based on users' behaviour on the platform.
In the same way, those tokens could be used to gain benefits and special services offered by TradingLab.
Lastly, a token can also be seen as medium to fidelise influencers and subscribers.

## Marketing
TradingLab's growth and development are dependant to few keys marketing channel.
As first, the best marketing is having a great product pleasant to use. This is the reason why development is taking longer than expected.
A proper blog, as well as a Youtube channel will be used to update regularlly TradingLab's followes.
But yet the two main marketing channels are Discord, and Influencers.

### Discord
It is critically important being able to create an healty and active community on Discord.
The landing page needs to invite to join the community using clear messages, which will be A/B tested properly.
A part of TradingLab's revenues will be allocated to admin and moderators.

### Influencers
The main marketing channel is the ability to involve influencers in the growth of TradingLab.
An influencer has an important audience on the main social media, and the possibility to convert a part of it to TradingLab's users would mean making more profit to them.
The idea would be to incentize influencers to use and share while interacting with their audience, keeping bulding the win-win apporach above mentioned.
