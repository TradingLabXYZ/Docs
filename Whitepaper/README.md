# TradingLab
**Hyper Hybrid Crypto Trading Community**

## Introduction
At the time of writing this document, the total market capitalisation of the crypto industry has reached two trillion dollars.
In a really conservative scenario this amount will double within years, thanks to capital injection of institutional investors as well as amatorial investors, both attracted by the idea of quick gains as well as the feeling of pioneering a whole new industry.

Innovation is thriving within the crypto industry. Many ideas and platform are built accordingly with the possibilities allowed by decentralised technologies.

The rise of web3 paradigm has opened up a new form of interaction between users and platforms, in which there is no need anymore to fulfill a KYC process in order to access certain functionalites, most of them purely financial based, such as sending money.

One of the most interesting possibility is to have micro transactions withing a web application. Subscription model, special features, prices, can be fully regulated by smart contracts in a easy fashion way, without the necessity to rely to third party players, saving in this way an important amount of money due to fees. For example, with Stripe, a fee of 3% plus 30 cents per transaction is payed.

## Vision
TradingLab aims to create a funny, addictive, never ending user experience in which crypto passionates can converge, learning and earning from each others simply sharing their crypto portfolios.

## Problem
There are plenty portfolio trackers available online. The main distinction between them is between being automatically or manually updated.
They allow anybody to keep track of the behavior of cryto holdings.
Most of them are too complex to use, generating confusion and uncertanties. 
Others, are more user friendly, but black boxed, which means not open source, or not sharable across users.
Finally there are fully automated ones, able to import data directly from centralized/decentralized platforms, but in this case there is always a limit in terms of privacy and security.

## Market
TradingLab has identified two key stakeholders playing an critical role into the crypto economy: experienced traders
and new entry traders. In this document we will define the former as *influencers*, while the latter as *subscribers*.

### Influencers
We define as influencers those traders which have been able to successfully create an online community around their
talent. Their main communication medium are tools such as Twitter, Reddit, Discord and Youtube.
Their approach is often to create curiosity and FOMO around their successes.
They often share charts and graphical representations on their ideas.
Despite so, it is rare to see an influencer sharing precisly the amount invested, or the total profit generated.
Execpt a few cases, most of the influencers do not fully monetize their crypto abilities.
Influencers are leaders able to take initiative.

### Subscribers
Subscribers are those traders which have interest in crypto but still not fully part of the movement. Their
lack of experience and risk adversion are a limit of the potential of their success. They like to follow other traders,
gathering ideas of new tokens to invest on, as well as when it is time to enter or leave a position.
Due to an overwhealming amount of information available online, it is often difficult for a subscriber to choose an influencer to follow.
Subscribers do not want to lead.

## Product
This section describes the key features of TradingLab and what makes it unique and special.

### 1 - Portfolio
At the core TradingLab is a portfolio tracker.
Focusing on a clear and minimal design, it allows to seamlessy keep track of a
certain crypto investment.
The data insertion is fully manual, there is no plan to introduce automation in that area.
Using TradingLab a user is always able to know the status of the investments done, being able to update them with minimal effort.

### 2 - Infinite scrolling
Each user as a public fully visibile profile, which can be easily shared by url.
This feature opens up interesting possibilits to build an "ininitive" scrolling experience, because it will be fun and easy to jump to a
new profile, exploring other traders, their favouirite crypto and their opened positions.
A user can scroll th activity wall, and jump to a trader profile particulary interesting. Here after having explored the macro portfolio, the user can open a single trade to visualise the details, add a comment, and potentially follow the trader.

### 3 - Subscription
An influencer can decide to allow other users to visualise the profile only if a monthly fee is payed.
The amount of that fee is decided by the influencer, and a percentage of that value is allocated to TradingLab.
TradingLab has created a software able to offer a win-win solution to both influencers and subscribers.
The former are finally able to monetise their talent, while the latter are finally able to learn from the best.
Influencers have a place where to share their trades and portfolio, and thanks to a subscription model, earning from it.

### 4 - Real-time
TradingLab aims to create a funny user experience, and this depends on real time updates.
When a user opens up a profile, if there is a change of price, or if there is an update on the trades, automagically those changes will be displayed.
This is possibile thanks to a websockets based algorithm, and also in this case, this feature aims to open interesting possibilities in terms of user interaction, for example, allowing groups of friends working together on the platform, or streamers updating the trades in real time while people are watching the profile.

### 5 - Decentralisation
As crypto platform, TradingLab aims in the future to become a fully decentralised dapp.
This goal can be achived only through an iterative process, starting from the user authentication.
Users are able to enter the plaform using their Metamask wallets, this means TradingLab does not store any personal data.
This generates great advantages in terms of development, security and privacy.

### 6 - Blockchain
TradingLab has decided to build on top of the Polkadot/Kusama's ecosytsem.
As third generation blockchain, they offer a level of security, speed and fees fully aligned with the needs of TradingLab.
In particular, Moonbeam wll be used to host all the smart contracts necessary to TradingLab
With Moonbeam, smart contract written in solidity are possible, as well as using the excellent tool chains developed for the Ethereum ecosystem.
The idea is to propose TradingLab to receive a grant from Moonriver or Polkaddot foundations in a near future.

### 7 - Smart contracts
Smart contracts are used to regulate the interactions between influencers and subscribers.
The possibilites offered by smart contracts are extendable also to micro services within the platform itself.
For example if a user wants to add a special profile picture, or to sponsor the profile, all these features can be regulated by smart contracts.

### 8 - Off-chain data
TradingLab understands how in order to offer a great and smooth user experience, centralized data are still strongly necessary.
All the trades and subtrades data are stored off chain, allowing the real time mecanism above descibed.
Nevertheless, the intragration between off-chain and on-chain data can open interesting opportunites, such as monitoring smart contracts behaviour on the backend and subsequentely triggering certains functions connected to the off-chain database. 

### 9 - Token
The creation of a token dedicated to TradingLab, despite not being a truly proproty, allows the creation of really interesting scenarios.
As first, to ensure a truly decentralized apporach, a token could be used to gain bote power for a DAO.
The token could allow the creation of initiatives, campaigns, and lotteries based on users' behaviour on the platform.
In the same way, those tokens could be used to gain benefits and special services offered by TradingLab.
Lastly, a token can also be seen as medium to fidelise influencers and subscribers.

## Marketing
The best marketing is having a great product pleasant to use.
This is the reason why development is taking following the hard path.
From a pure marketing point of view, A proper blog, as well as a Youtube channel will be used to update regularlly TradingLab's followes.
But yet the two main marketing channels are Discord, and Influencers.

### Discord
It is critically important being able to create an healty and active community on Discord.
A part of TradingLab's revenues will be allocated to admin and moderators.

### Influencers
The main marketing channel is the ability to involve influencers in the growth of TradingLab.
An influencer has an important audience on the main social media, and the possibility to convert a part of it to TradingLab's users would mean making more profit to them.
The idea would be to incentize influencers to use and share while interacting with their audience, keeping bulding the win-win apporach above mentioned.
