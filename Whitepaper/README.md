## Introduction
At the time of writing this document, the total market capitalisation of crypto industry has reached two trillion dollars.

In a really conservative scenario this amount will double within years, due to capital injection of institutional investors as well as amatorial investors, both attracted by the idea of quick gains as well as the feeling of pioneering a whole new industry.

Innovation is thriving within this industry.

Many ideas and platforms are built accordingly with the possibilities allowed by decentralised technologies.

The rise of web3 paradigm has opened up a new form of interaction between users and platforms, in which there is no need anymore to fulfill a KYC process in order to access certain functionalites, most of them purely financial based, such as sending money.

One of the most interesting possibility is to have micro transactions within a web application, such as ubscription model, special features, prices. All these functionalities can be fully regulated by smart contracts in a easy fashion way, without the necessity to rely to third party players, saving in this way an important amount of money due to fees. 

## Vision
TradingLab aims to create a funny, addictive, never ending user experience in which crypto passionates can converge, learning and earning from each others simply sharing their crypto portfolios.

## Problem
There are plenty of portfolio trackers available online. They allow everybody to keep track of the behavior of crypto holdings. 

The main distinction between them is between being automatically or manually updated, centralized or decentralized.

Most of them are too complex to use, generating confusion and uncertanties among non crypto-savvy users.

Others are more user friendly, but black boxed, which means not open source or not allowing a social-network approach across users.

Finally there are fully automated ones, able to import data directly from centralized/decentralized platforms, but in this case there is always a limit in terms of privacy, security and flexibility.

In the _Competitors_ section we further explore the actual ecosytsem.

## Market
TradingLab has identified three categories of users which could benefit from the platform: experienced traders, influencers traders and new entry traders. In this document we define the former as *experienced*, the second as *influencers*, the latter as *newcomers*.

### Experienced
This category includes all the professional traders out there which are able to successfully profit from trading activities, but without any social media communication.

They often hide themselft behind "normal looking" social media accounts. They are keen to know more about new interesting possissibility offered by the crypto economy, but without exposing or revealing themself. They share their knowledge with a limited circle of connection and they do not have interest in expanding their network further.

Experienced are silent leaders able to take initiative.

### Influencers
We define as influencers those traders which have been able to successfully create an online community around their
talent. Their main communication medium are tools such as Twitter, Reddit, Discord and Youtube.
Their approach is often to create curiosity and FOMO around their successes. They often share charts and graphical representations on their ideas.

Despite so, it is rare to see an influencer sharing precisly the amount invested, or the total profit generated.
There is no certanties the profit they claim to make, nor there is a possibility to verify if what they say is accurate. Execpt a few cases, most of the influencers do not fully monetize their crypto abilities.

Influencers are loud leaders able to take initiative.

### Newcomers
Newcomers are those traders which have interest in crypto but still not fully part of the movement. Their lack of experience and risk adversion are a limit of the potential of their success. They like to follow other traders, gathering ideas of new tokens to invest on, as well as when it is time to enter or leave a position.

Due to an overwhealming amount of information available online, it is often difficult for a subscriber to choose an influencer to follow. They do not hide themself on social media, and they usually like to belong to bigger community.

Subscribers do not want to lead.

## Product
This section describes the key features of TradingLab and what makes it unique and special.

### 1 - Portfolio
At the core TradingLab is a portfolio/investment tracker.
Focusing on a clear and minimal design, it allows to seamlessy monitor multiple crypto investment.

With TradingLab a user is always able to know the status of investments done with minimal effort. The set of functionalities is limited, creating low entry barriers in terms of learning process.

Despite having the possibility to interact with the platform with APIs, the data insertion is fully manual.

### 2 - Social
By design, each user has a unique URL associated to a blockchain address. The URL can be shared and opened by anybody, expect if the user decide otherwise.
This openess allows the possibility to create a "infinitive scrolling experience" in which in a glance it is possibile to see what other users have done in terms of crypto investments. A user can scroll through the feed, jumping to a trader profile particulary interesting. Here after having explored the macro portfolio, the user can open a single trade to visualise the details, add a comment, and potentially follow the trader.

### 3 - Subscription
A user can decide to allow other users to visualise the profile only if a fee is payed. The amount of that fee is decided by the user. A percentage of that value is allocated to TradingLab.

These functionalities are fully regolated by smart-contracts.
The fees are displayed in US dollars because of ease of understading, but behind the scene they are converted into crypto tokens using a proper oracle.

TradingLab offers a safe environment, for this reason all the funds stay in user wallets. Every time a transaction happens, the amount if immediatly sent to the involved wallets.

This subscription model creates a win-win-win solution. The subscriber gets insights about certain investments, the subsribed finally monetises the talent, and TradingLab earn a fee from this process.

### 4 - Real-time
TradingLab aims to create a funny user experience, and this depends on real time updates.

When a user opens up a certain profile, if there is a change of price, or if there is an update on the trades, automagically those changes will be displayed.

This is possibile thanks to a websockets based algorithm, and also in this case, this feature aims to open interesting possibilities in terms of user interaction, for example, allowing groups of friends working together on the platform, or streamers updating the trades in real time while people are watching the profile.

This same structure can be extended in the future to other areas of TradingLab currently under evaluation.

### 5 - Decentralisation
As crypto platform, TradingLab aims in the future to become a fully decentralised dapp. This goal can be achived only through an iterative process, which started from the user authentication.

Users are able to enter the plaform using their Metamask wallets, this means TradingLab does not store any personal data.

All the data about trades are stored in a centralized database, but with the rise of more user-friendly web3 technologies, this whole part will be managed on-chain.

Web3 technologies in general provide advantages in terms of development, security and privacy, despite being still not easy to integrate. Thinking in a long term scenario in which Web3 technologies will dominate the market, TradingLab wants to accept the current limitation of them because confident that this will create competitive advantage in a medium term future.

### 6 - Blockchain
TradingLab has decided to build on top of the Polkadot/Kusama's ecosytsem. As third generation blockchain, they offer a level of security, speed and fees fully aligned with the needs of TradingLab.

In particular, Moonbeam is the ecosystem choosed to host all the smart contracts necessary to TradingLab. With Moonbeam, smart contracts are written in solidity, as well as using the excellent tool chains developed for the Ethereum ecosystem.

Polkadot, Kusama, Moonbeam have created an extraordinary ecosytem of community in which is easy to raise questions and receive supports from experts.

Nevertheless, the idea is to propose in the future TradingLab  as candidate to receive a grant from Moonriver or Polkadot foundations.

### 7 - Smart contracts
Smart contracts will be primarly used in three different areas of TradingLab.

As first, as said previously, smart contracts are used to regulate the subscription model between users and TradingLab itself.

Secondary, smart contracts are extendable also to micro services within the platform itself. For example if a user wants to add a special profile picture, or to sponsor the profile, all these features can be regulated by smart contracts.

Lastly, there is an idea to create competition across users, also in this case, transarently regulated by smart contracts.

These are only three of the scenarios in which smart contracts can be applied to TradingLab. During development new skills and competences will be acquired, making possibile to envision new ideas.

### 8 - Off-chain data
TradingLab understands how in order to offer a great and smooth user experience, centralized data are still strongly necessary.

Nevertheless, the intragration between off-chain and on-chain data can open interesting opportunites, such as monitoring smart contracts behaviour on the backend and subsequentely triggering certains functions connected to the off-chain database.

### 9 - Token
The creation of a token dedicated to TradingLab, despite not being a true priority, cannot be excluded.

It could allow the creation of really interesting scenarios.

For example, to ensure a truly decentralized apporach, a token could be used to gain bote power for a DAO. The token could allow the creation of initiatives, campaigns, and lotteries based on users' behaviour on the platform. In the same way, those tokens could be used to gain benefits and special services offered by TradingLab. A token can also be seen as medium to fidelise users.
	
Lastly, a token relase can become a strong medium to raise funds from early stage investors.

## Marketing
The best marketing is having a great product pleasant to use.
This is the bet behind TradingLab.

Once the product is considered pleasent to use, the idea is to onboard experienced and influencers, possibily generating a network effect able to dramatically increase the amount of users on the platform.

From a pure marketing point of view, a blog, as well as a Youtube channel will be used to update regularlly TradingLab's followes.

## Community
It is critically important being able to create an healty and active community. From this point of view, nothing is better of Discord, a place in which any crypto project needs to be present.

Discord will be used as main medium of announcment, replacing the old idea of email newsletter. Moreover, in Discord bugs and suggestion will be reported.

A part of TradingLab's revenues will be allocated to admin and moderators in order to keep the environment safe, interesting and funny to use.

Discord offers many advanced functionalities, which can be connected to TradingLab's ones to further engage users.

## Team
As time of writing this document, TradingLab is a one person team, relying on a freelancer designer and a integration tester.

The quanitity of work is enourmous, and within the upcoming months with the launch of the product the idea is to onboard developers interested to join this early-stage project. The open-source code is another way to attract contributors.

At full time regime TradingLab can start to compete with a five people team: two developers, a designer, a product manager and a marketer. Each people of the team needs to be full-stack, meaning being able to cover different areas, using multiple tools, eager to fast learn new skills.

## Technology
The dogma behind TradingLab is to seek simplicity. This ambitious goal can be achived not only using solid and proved technology, but also shaping the complexity of the ideas into easy-to-manage features.

Semplicity is an interative goal, often starting from a dirty rough prototype. Building a product like TradingLab means accepting the need to start from scretch multiple times.

We are trying to write software containing as less dependencies as possibile.

The core components of TradingLab are:
- front end written using Typescript Vuejs
- backend api using Golang
- Postgresql database
- backend api using Rust to read smart contract data
- a set of smart contracts written is Solidity
- DigitalOcean to host backend engines
- Stormkit to host frontend engines
- Github to host the code
- Figma to prototype ideas

## OpenSource
One of the main paradigm of web3 is open sourceness. There is an urge on transparency, and this can only be achived if the code is visible.

Here comes the decision of fully opening the code behind TradingLab, despite the risk of being copy-cat by other teams. We believe this decision can generate a positive effect in the long term.

Being open can enahnce the possibility to attract talented developers interested in contribuiting into the source code, as well as, clearly showing how the developers of TradingLab believe in the product.

## Design
One of the biggest obsession of TradingLab core team is to create a design modern, minimal, cool and easy to understand.
Also in this case, simplicity is at a core of any decision taken.

The team is currently learning a lot in term of design, and it is evaluating the possibility to interact with multiple professonal freelancers in other to gather as many point of view as possibile.

## Socials
A moder project needs to have an active social media activity to regularly post updates about the product.

TradingLab believes in quality above quantity, here the decision to have a single Twitter page, at least in this early stage of the project.

A further social media used by TradingLab is going to be Youtube. The possibilities offered by a video-based communication medium are endless, many ideas are currently being evaluated in this direction.

## Competitors
There is no a clear competitor doing exact the same thing as TradingLab.

Many products out there are offering multiple services, including as side one a portfolio manager.
