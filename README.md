# TradingLab's Docs

Here a curated list of all the documents graviting around TradingLab.

Github has been choosen has platform to produce these documents because of the possibility to work simultaneously,
keeping track of progresses and changes.

The ability and necessity to produce high quality documentations need to be addressed properly, as well as code itself.

Moreover, this writing activity is also an opportunity to interrupt the purlely technical job required while developing
TradingLab.
